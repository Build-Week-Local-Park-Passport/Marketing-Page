            <h3>Our Mission</h3>
            <p>We are driven to help people have fun! Everyone has activities that they enjoy doing and hobbies they want to develop. We believe the best way to do that is to get outside.</br>
            No matter where you are there is a park or trail nearby for you to enjoy. Our job is to help you find it easily. You can even leave reviews! </br>
